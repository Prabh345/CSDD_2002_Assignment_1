Part 1: Flexbox and Grid Layout Mastery
In this part, I demonstrated my mastery of both Flexbox and Grid Layout by using the following properties:

Flexbox:
display: flex
justify-content: center, justify-content: space-between
align-items: center, align-items: flex-start
flex-wrap: wrap
gap: 20px
flex-direction: row
order for controlling item order

Grid Layout:
display: grid
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))
gap: 20px
grid-column: span
These properties were used to build and structure different sections of the website, including the header, about section, skills, and projects.

Part 2: Portfolio Website using Flexbox and Grid
In this part, I used Flexbox and Grid Layout to build a personal portfolio website. The following sections were created:

Header: Used Flexbox to create a responsive navigation bar with a logo and social media links (GitHub and LinkedIn).
About Section: Used Flexbox to align an image and text side by side.
Skills Section: Used Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout for listing skills.
Education Section: Displayed educational qualifications using Flexbox for responsive item layout.
Projects Section: Used Grid Layout to display multiple project cards in a responsive grid.
Interests Section: Created a flexbox layout for listing personal interests in a flexible, responsive layout.
Footer Section: A simple footer with contact information.

Part 3: Migrating to React
In Part 3, I migrated the static portfolio website (built using Flexbox and Grid) into a React app:

Created React components for each section of the portfolio: Header, About, Education, Skills, Projects, Interests, and Footer.
The layout and styling from Part 2 were maintained in the React components.
The app was organized in a modular structure, making it easier to manage and update each section independently.
